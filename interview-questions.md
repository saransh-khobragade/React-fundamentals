## React interview questions

* Are customhooks different from components
    - Components render UI return UI elements ,hooks just output
    - functions components are also hooks
    - Use a component when you want to package UI (markup) + behavior together and keep the visual output consistent.
    - Use a custom hook when you want to share stateful logic across many places but let each caller control the UI.
